Installation
******************************************
To install this mod you first need to install EUP Menu and EUP Law & Order : 
EUP Menu : https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/13245-eup-menu/
EUP L&O : https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/character/8151-emergency-uniforms-pack-law-order/

Then, go to : (OpenIV)
    GTA V > mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks > eup > dlc.rpf > x64 >

Then just drag and drop each files into the corresponding foler.
    Example : to install the [eup_componentpeds > mp_m_freemode_01_male_heist] files, go to  [dlc.rpf > x64 > eup_componentpeds.rpf > mp_m_freemode_01_male_heist] and drop the mod's [mp_m_freemode_01_male_heist] folder's content.

If the folder doesn't exist, drop the whole folder instead of each file.
    Example : to intall the [eup_componentpeds > mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_clothes_01] you need to drop the folder (and not the files) in eup_componentpeds.rpf
